--- graphs are very hard to be identical
	- maximas are therefore not conssitent
--- entropy @ % is more consistent
	- lower values are even more consistent but have much less features
--- blurring is very much required



first to entropy = 0.5, or if a max is reached before that

or if a max is reached before 0.5 => it is not a useable point?
