distance-ratio - constrain nearby features in second image by limits of first image

Iterative closest point

brightness constancy

camera extrinsic matrix - P (rarely R) = inverse camera absolute matrix, transforms points in world coordinates to camera coordinates

camera intrinsic matrix - K conversion from projected points (essential) to image points (fundamental)

camera center - location of camera in world

principle point - location (projection) of camera center in IMAGE

essential matrix - E - relates points in camera screen from one view to lines in another (point to line)

fundamental matrix - F - relates points in camera image from one image to lines in another; uncalibrated E matrix

homography matrix - H - relates ponts in one coordinate system (image) to points in another (image)


canny lines -> edges
