# App Experience / Capabilities

### MVP:
- calibrate camera
- import picture set
- run (low res) modeling
- view (low res) model locally
- save multiple (limited) models
- share models [privately]
	- 


### Extended:

#### share model
	=> needs to upload to server to share
		- save preview image & model resources on server
		- accessible via random hash
	=> would need moderation?


#### save unlimited models locally

#### export as PLY, STL, ... ETC

#### export texture map (+ model)

#### medium resolution

#### high resolution

#### offload processing jobs to cloud




### Screens:

#### main menu
	- browse shared projects [see other's models/images]
	- browse MY existing projects
	- new project

#### project browser
	- summarized with pictures / name / created / modified
		- source images
		- exported model screen capture
		- large model picture in BG [or slowly animating low-poly version]

#### project
	- add image [file browse from documents]
	- remove images
	- edit usable image area [masking out areas not to be used for: point matching / calculations]
	- calibrate camera settings [pick one of pre-existing cameras or do calibration]
	- execute/calculate [perform 3d reconstruction processes] -- iteritive: only do necessary update calculations
		- show progress / status?
			- image pairing/matching [sparse, dense]
			- 3d point projection [colored cloud]
			- texturing
	- view model
	- 
#### model viewer
	- 3d orientable/navigating
	- change camera settings [multiple cameras / views]
	- take picture [create novel perspective image]
	- share model
	- export
		- model
		- texture
	- apply filter (texture) [sephia, grayscale, solarize, smooth, invert, ...]
	- background color/image
#### image importer
	- images
	- video components [may need a separate camera calibration]
		- time-scale grabber
#### image editor
	- brush size
	- add / remove toggle mode
