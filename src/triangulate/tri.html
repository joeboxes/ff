/*

location alg:


sensors have some random min/max signal value
	- disappates as r^2
	- has cutoff if too far away 
	- signal is noisy
	- known 2D/3D location

as time passes:
	- target keeps track of table of: sensor & intensity value

location:
	- estimated by looking at average of last intensity values & relative errors/sigmas
	- each sensor:
		- intensity with mean sigma
		- 
-> moving around should help somehow => relative 
	= closer & further away
		- with some error






each beacon is it's own estimator of object's location
	- tries to estimate maximum power based on readings from 
	- can then use square power falloff to more accurately estimate user's distance
	- as target moves, it gets closer and further from beacons
		=> close/far have only so many possibilities of location
		=> two-timestamp vectors can only exist in finite locations
		
		-> finite element analysis
			-> each point that can satisfy simultaneous situations gets a +1 /errorWindow [HOT/COLD]
			=> object has finite probability region

		-> with region probability:
			=> some range of power

	=> with power estimation and region liklihood:
		-> some most likely location of target

each time-stamp has a location of each beacon
