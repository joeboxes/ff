# things


## things go down: things fall
	- lighter things and heaver things fall down in the same fashion
	- the longer things are suspended (in the air) the faster they fall
		- velocity increasing at a constant rate = acceleration




### sun
	- is a constant angular size in the sky
		- on the horizon 
	- light from sun travels in parallel lines

### moon
	- bright side is consistent with direction of sun

### stars
	- in the norther hemisphere, stars rotate one direction
	- in souther hemisphere, stars rotate in opposite direction

### seasons
	- wet season / dry season
	- spring / summer / autumn / winter
	- occurr at opposite times of the year depending on location (hemisphere)
	- parts of earth get more sun at different times of the year

### horizon
	- things disappear bottom-up
	- infinite plane is higher than apparent horizon

### atmosphere
	- the further below the water, the higher the pressure
	- the further above from the surface of the earth, the lower the pressure (falls off inverse squared - ish)
	- at some point above earth, the pressure gradient approaches zero

### measurement
	- velocity
		- measuring tape distance, drops / hourglass / stopwatch
	- acceleration
		- distances reached with differing times
	- relative mass
		- balance beam
		- scale (spring / resistor)
	- pressure
		- mm of mercury
		- force on a resistor
	- ...


### thermodynamics
	- movement of heat / energy


### mass - 0
	- if you burn a log inside of a bubble, the weight before will equal the weight after (to a very high approximation)
	- if you keep track of all the mass in an experiment, it does not dissappear, and more mass does not appear
	- mass cannot be created or destroyed, only converted into different forms
	- exceptions:
		- (when dealing with very energetic particles [something people rarely experience and only recently in history], eg in a nuclear reactor this is not true, but superceded by conservation of energy)
			- mass - energy equivalence
		- (when unstable particles decay their mass is lost to eg photons or other particles, but because earth has been around a while most of the unstable masses have already decayed and are not present)


#### 0th Law
	- if a = b & b = c -> a = c
	- if objects a & b are in equalibrium and objects b & c are in equalibrium
	- => objects a & b & c are all in equilibrium
	- temperature is a thing, it exists

#### 1st Law
	- if you push something it goes faster, but at the expense of you getting tired
	- if a car breaks are applied it will slows down, but at the expense of the breaks heating up
	- if two cars driving at high speeds collide their speeds go to zero, but at the expense of the metal and material being collapsed
	- => energy does not disappear, it is only converted into different forms
	- conservation of energy (book-keeping)
	- the change in energy of a closed system &equiv; heat energy supplied - work done by the system
	- &Delta;U = Q - W 

	- types of energy:
		- kenetic [mechanical]
			- linear
			- rotational
		- potential
			- gravitational
			- spring
			- molecular bonds
		- thermal / heat
		- chemical
		- electrical
		- nuclear
		- mass

#### 2nd Law
	- you can break an egg, but it is very difficult to put an egg back together afterwards
	- you can light a log on fire, but it is very difficult to turn the byproducts (gasses & carbon) back into a log
	- things that happen forward in time are hard to replicate backward in time
	- things like friction always oppose a process, whether it is the forward or reverse process
	- processes are not reversible
	- the transferred heat &lte; the temperature &times; the change in entropy
	- &delta;Q = T&middot;dS

#### 3rd Law
	- as things get colder, they move less
	- when all energy is remove from an object, the minimum thermal energy, it is at absolute zero
	- entropy of an object = (scale factor for units times) logarithmic scale of: all possible states
	- S = k<sub>boltzmann</sub> &middot; ln &Omega;
	- absolute zero: 0 entropy = ln(1 state)


### motion
	- laws of motion

#### 1st Law
	- things move at a constant velocity until interacted via forces
	- inertia

#### 2nd Law
	- Force = change is momentum = &Delta;p = dp / dt
	- Force = mass &middot; acceleration

#### 3rd Law
	- any two objects interacting thru forces have an equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in direction) reactions
	- conservation of momentum
	

#### special relativitey

#### general relativitey


#### field equations
	G<sup>ab</sup> + &Lambda;&middot;g<sup>ab</sup> = 8&middot;&pi;&middot;T<sup>ab</sup>

	- in weak gravitational field (? = 0)
	- in slow motion (v/c ~ 0)
	- reduces to F = G &middot; m<sub>1</sub>&middot;m<sub>2</sub> / r<sup>2</sup>




### visuals

- horizon @ human scale (eye level ~ 10 feet)

- hot air baloon (4 ~ 5 miles)

- airplane (6 ~ 10 miles)

- baloon (toy helium ~ 10 miles)

- high alititude baloon (helium, hydrogen, methane, 20 ~ 25 miles)

- space station / space station (~ 250 miles)

- satellites (LEO ~ 1k miles, GEO ~ 22k miles, HEO ~ 35k miles)
